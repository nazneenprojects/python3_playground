"""
NOTES:
Method Resolution Order (MRO): Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the order in which base classes are
initialized and methods are resolved. This ensures a consistent and predictable method resolution order, even in complex inheritance hierarchies.

super() Function: The super() function is used to call methods from the parent class, ensuring that each class in
the inheritance chain is properly initialized. In multilevel inheritance, itâ€™s crucial to call super().__init__() in each subclass's constructor
to ensure proper initialization from top to bottom.

Attribute and Method Access: An instance of the most derived class (in this case, Child) can access attributes and methods
from all levels in the inheritance hierarchy, demonstrating the power of multilevel inheritance.
